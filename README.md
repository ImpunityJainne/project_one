# Tender: An app for indecisive foodies

See the app: https://impunityjainne.github.io/project_one/

This app is the culimnation of a week's worth of work for a class project. The contributing team members are: [Michael Guillen](https://github.com/michaelguillen7), [Eric Galassi](https://github.com/ewgalassi), [Selma Delgado](https://github.com/selmadelgado), [John Kim](https://github.com/whoisjohnkim), and myself.

We were tasked with a project that would allow us to:
- practice working as a team to collaborate and develop a polished product in a short amount of time
- practice using coding best practices (indentation, scoping, naming)
- familiarize ourselves with using new APIs
- research and use new technologies not covered in class, such as Materialize CSS
- practice storing and accessing persistent data in Firebase

We presented on the project on 8/15/2018. The presentation slides are currently [available for viewing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11WYlLIzP8OBctpgzHohce0qaalZ-VKHWOOGW1Yuz8wo/edit?usp=sharing). The video presentation will be posted soon.
